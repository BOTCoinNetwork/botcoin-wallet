# EVM-Lite Wallet

A user interface to interact with EVM-Lite.

## Installation
To build and run `EVM-Lite Wallet`, simply execute the command: 

```
make
```

This will install all dependencies and  run an electron window 
rendering the contents of the built project from the `dist` folder.

## Usage
If the installation was successful you should see the electron window 
that looks something similar to this:

![Alt Wallet Homepage](assets/homepage.png?raw=true "Wallet")

### Data Directory
All accounts created, transactions sent and configuration changes will
be saved to the data directory specified in the Settings tab of the
wallet. The data directory by default with be set to 
`~/.evmlc` which is the same as 
[`evm-lite-cli`](https://github.com/mosaicnetworks/evm-lite-cli).

If you decide to change the data directory to a new location where
the `keystore` folder or the `config.toml` file are not present, they will
be generated by default.

![Alt Data Directory](assets/datadirectory.png?raw=true "Data Dir")

Note: The keystore is relative to the configuration file and not the 
data directory.
