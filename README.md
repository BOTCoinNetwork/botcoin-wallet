# EVM-Lite Wallet

A user interface to interact with EVM-Lite.

## Development

Curretly working with a development version of `evm-lite-lib`. Clone `evm-lite-lib` and checkout the `node12` branch (soon to be removed).

Navigate the the `evm-lite-lib` then rune the following commands:

```bash
cd ./src/evm-lite-core/ && npm install && npm link 
cd ../../ && npm install && npm link evm-lite-core && npm link
```

This will add a symlink of the `evm-lite-lib`.

Now to finish up setting up the development evironment run these commands in `evm-lite-wallet`:

```bash
npm install && npm link evm-lite-lib && npm run build
```

Now you should have a the foundations set up to run the `electron` and the `dev-server`.

### Development Server (Hot Reloading)

```bash
npm run start:dev
```

### Electron Window

```bash
npm run start:electron
```

## Installation

To build and run `EVM-Lite Wallet`, simply execute the command:

```console
npm run start
```

This will install all dependencies and run an electron window
rendering the contents of the built project from the `dist` folder.

### Data Directory

All accounts created, transactions sent and configuration changes will
be saved to the data directory specified in the Settings tab of the
wallet. The data directory by default with be set to
`~/.evmlc` which is the same as
[`evm-lite-cli`](https://github.com/mosaicnetworks/evm-lite-cli).

If you decide to change the data directory to a new location where
the `keystore` folder or the `config.toml` file are not present, they will
be generated by default.

Note: The keystore is relative to the configuration file and not the
data directory.
