# EVM-Lite Wallet

A user interface to interact with EVM-Lite.

## Installation

To build and run `EVM-Lite Wallet`, simply execute the command:

```console
npm run start
```

This will install all dependencies and run an electron window
rendering the contents of the built project from the `dist` folder.

### Data Directory

All accounts created, transactions sent and configuration changes will
be saved to the data directory specified in the Settings tab of the
wallet. The data directory by default with be set to
`~/.evmlc` which is the same as
[`evm-lite-cli`](https://github.com/mosaicnetworks/evm-lite-cli).

If you decide to change the data directory to a new location where
the `keystore` folder or the `config.toml` file are not present, they will
be generated by default.

Note: The keystore is relative to the configuration file and not the
data directory.
